    | Cordie had never been a very big fan of Valentine’s Day. In fact, she abhorred the thought of it and decided that St. Valentine could shove his you-know-what, you-know-where. 

  p.fade
    | She was not someone who did not like love or relationships or guys or any of that. She even liked it when all the heart shaped chocolate went on sale the day after. It was not even the fact that she hated being single. She actually quite liked it, thank you very much.

    |As a cupid, Cordelia (Cordie for short), February 14th was the most important and stressful day of the year. And in the year of 2019, in which more dating apps than ever ruined people’s love lives, this day was going to be a piece of work. For the love and desire cupids, this was the best day of the year because they got to go around shooting red-heart shaped arrows into people’s asses. But as one of the cupids who was sent to clean up the messes that the other, more reckless cupids, today was the worst.

    |Fixer cupids had a hard time getting along with the other cupids. Fixer cupids were logical, guided by their brains. The love and desire cupids were basically the opposite of that. Of course each was their own cupid and had were guided by varying degrees of logos and pathos but, in general, fixer cupids felt like the other cupids were careless and selfish, while the other cupids thought the fixer cupids were rigid and, “totally un-fun.”

    |  “How many times do we have to tell Cy not to make the Bride and the best man fall for each other a week before the wedding?” Esme, one of the other fixer-cupids, said as she beat her head against one of the many white pillars around the large office. 
  p.fade
    | The office itself sat atop of a cloud, right above the Eiffel Tower in Paris, France. Some thought it was a rather obvious and passé location for Venus’s office to be located, but since she herself gave the city its title of “the city of love” it made sense.

    | Cordie leaned on the same pillar next to Esme, sipping a cup of lukewarm coffee. She brushed back a strand of light rose colored hair wrapped up into a bun atop her head. It was rare to see her with her hair down, especially at work. The two looked out over the large white room, romantically (though some might say gaudily) decorated of red and pink silks, couches and pillows around the room. “When has Cy ever listened to anyone but himself?” Cordie answered with a question. 

  p.fade
    | “One time,” a voice announced from behind the pillar making the two girls jump, “but that did not end well for Liz, Dick or me.” There Cy stood, dark hair tussled effortlessly as always (which was no small feat considering how much he flew), standing before them without a care for all the messes the girls would have to clean up for him. Nor did he seem to mind that making the girls jumped caused Cordie to spill some of her coffee on Esme.

    | “Speak of the devil and he shall appear,” Esme muttered. She brushed past Cy in order to attempt to save the pink shirt she bought specifically for today. Cy smirked as Esme made sure to hit his shoulder with her own on her way past, “A pleasure as always Esme.” Esme responded with a less-than-congenial hand gesture before she disappeared into a sea of cupids. 

    
  p.fade
    | Esme was not one to mess with. You know that meme where it says “looks like a cinnamon roll but could actually kill you?” Well she looked like she could kill you and would most certainly kill you. Her bright blue hair was buzzed to half an inch and she had tattoos covering the left side of her upper body starting from her neck to her hip. She was tall for a female cupid and liked to appear even taller by wearing platform black combat boots. If Cordie thought about it, she wasn’t sure she had ever seen Esme wearing a different pair of shoes. 

  p.fade
    | Cordie started to panic slightly as she realized the two were alone and Cy seemed far too happy about it. “You know, I cannot even remember the last time we were alone together. Oh wait,” Cy’s smile only grew wider with Cordie’s discomfort. 



  p.fade
    | “That’s funny, because I can barely remember the moment at all since it happened so incredibly fast,” Cordie did her best to cover up her embarrassment with her words but they both noticed her blush. She hated everything about him. Just like Valentine’s Day. He was just like all the other desire Cupids. Cocky, attractive, devious, and all-around douchey. These qualities were even more amplified since he was Venus’s favorite. 

  p.fade
    | If you were Venus’s favorite, you could practically get away with murder. The only caveat was that you belonged to Venus and Venus alone. That made their last encounter particularly unfortunate and despite Cordie being the only one that seemed phased by this, Cy knew it would not be good for either of them if anyone were to find out. The trouble was, Cy just could not stay away from the girl no matter how hard he tried.

    | “Say whatever you like, Cordelia, but we both know that night wasn’t one-sided.” 

  p.fade
    | Cordie lowered her voice and avoided eye contact with passerby’s as she whispered, “We also know that if anyone were to find out about that unfortunate lapse in judgment, we would both be in more trouble than Gwen and Connelly were with the whole Britney Spears and K Fed fiasco. And don’t call me Cordelia.”
    
      p.fade
    | Cy’s eyes went wide as he remembered his friends facing the wrath of Venus. Venus could be your most beautiful dream or your most terrifying nightmare. It was not something he would wish upon anyone. “Listen, I know there are a lot of things that could go horribly wrong if anyone knew, but that does not change the fact that I can’t stop thinking about you.” At his words, Cordie went completely silent as Cy continued, “Your laugh, your unnaturally pink hair, your lips, the way one eyebrow goes higher than the other when you’re trying to figure out to fix a mess I started. I can’t get you out of my head.”

  p.fade
    | Cordie stood motionless, completely dumbfounded. She had no idea he felt this way about her. For centuries the two had been at each other’s throats, but if she were honest with herself, she would admit that it was not just one night that led her to believe that she felt something other than anger for him. “I… I… But Venus…” She trailed off, unwilling to say what they both knew. 
    
      p.fade
    | Cy found her eyes with his and refused to let them go. The two stood there together, both trying to say everything the two felt without words. He reached out to push back a rogue strand of hair from her face, letting his hand linger just long enough for Cordie to relax into his hand. Feeling warmth spread from her cheek, down to the rest of her body. 

  p.fade
    | But the moment was ruined by erupting, uproarious laughter. Cy’ whole body shook as his right hand clutched at his stomach. Cordie watched in horror as she realized the trap she should have seen coming. “You,” Cy paused trying to catch his breath, “thought that I could honestly feel that way about you? You are absolutely nothing. I am for Venus and her alone. You cannot even begin to compare with her.” 
    
      p.fade
    | Now eyes and ears were starting to pay attention to the opposing cupids. To Cordie’s credit, she did her best to seem entirely unphased by the cruel trick, but her eyes could only hold back the tears for so long. “You’re right,” her voice shook as she spoke, “but at least I’m not a cruel, pathetic asshole who feels the need to make everyone else feel just has empty as himself.” 

  p.fade
    | Cordie did not even give him a chance to respond. She let her body guide her away from the boy she just couldn’t escape and let the tears fall freely. She told herself they were more from shock than anything else, but she wasn’t sure she believed it. “Cordie, what happened?” Esme questioned as she wrapped her thin arms around her best friend. “Who do I have to kill?” 
    
      p.fade
    | Cordie let out a wet chuckle as she tried her best to calm herself down. “No one. Today was just a reminder for why I hate Valentine’s Day.”

    | “You did perfectly,” a velvet voice floated through the gold room and surrounded Cy along with a delicious smell he could not place. Venus lounged atop a large bed as two men alternated between feeding her different types of fruits. “Although you did go off script a but, it really helped sell it. Now you can forget all about that little fixer. She’s nothing and I am your everything. Remember that, and no one gets hurt.” 

  p.fade
    | Cy smiled at the goddess, eyes taking all of her in as she beckoned him with a finger. When he turned to close the door, he saw the girl with rose colored hair and almost risked everything to go to her and tell her the truth. But he couldn’t do it. Not yet.

    | It had been a very trying week and she was looking forward to an easy Friday. Every single day, she came home covered in either a food, beverage, or both. She had two food fights, one very aggressive barbecue, and a proposal at a winery that did not go as planned. **Note to all who propose make sure you say the right name. 
    
   p.fade
    | Cordie was tired, overworked, and pissed off. Three out of the four fiascos were because a desire cupid got bored and decided to muck up a perfectly good relationship. Cordie did not mind fixing accidental hiccups in a love cupid’s plan, she did not even necessarily mind cleaning up after a less than detailed oriented desire cupid created a small, romantic-comedy worthy spat. She did however, very much mind, when a desire cupid specifically tried to ruin not only the couple, but many other people’s lives just for the fun of it. Friday’s assignment happened to be caused by the latter. 
  p.fade
    | Cordie sighed in frustration and despair when she saw the location of the assignment. Iowa was not exactly close to Paris and she knew that there was going to be a nasty storm of the Atlantic. She would have to fly higher to avoid the storm, but that meant she would use more energy than normal. That would not have been an issue if she were not feeling like she had been bit by a garbage truck. 
    
      p.fade
    | She could hop on a cu-bus but she it would take her longer. If she did not make it in time to stop the targets interacting with each other, it would be an even messier cleanup. But as she looked at the map at the center of Cupid HQ and saw the building storm cluster, her whole body seemed to scream “NO” at the top of its’ lungs.  

  p.fade
    | “The cu-bus it is,” she muttered to herself. She leafed through the file she found on her desk as she made her way to the closest source of coffee. Cupid HQ was a giant circle of passageways, meeting rooms, and lounge areas (that were filled more often than not with cupids acting unprofessionally) all surrounding a large area the size of two American football fields. The building was almost alive in a way, a labyrinth created with old magic that adapted at Venus’ will to be what she needed. The building grew with Venus and her cupids. 
    
      p.fade
    | At the center of the main room was a holographic globe spinning in the center. The globe was a way to keep track of the weather, air traffic, and cupid assignments. The walls and pillars were made entirely of white marble with gold trim. In small nooks and hidden alcoves, there were decorated lavishly with pillows and drapes made of the softest fabrics, all in a romantic shade of pink and red. 

  p.fade
    | The only parts of Cupid HQ that actually looked like an office, were the areas designed by the Fixer Cupids. Esme always says that if it were up to the Love and Desire Cupids, the whole building would be one big bedroom. 
      p.fade
    | The many coffee stations that littered the central room, referred to very creatively as “central” were the brainchild of a few fixer cupids who were tired of having to fly down to the streets of Paris to get their energy up. Cordie was grateful for it, but she did miss having the excuse to get away from the office every once and a while. 

  p.fade
    | “Saw your assignment for the day,” declared a familiar voice as Cordie reached for a white paper cup and hit the “double” option on the espresso machine. “I’m not surprised you’re having a double. Although if it were me, I would have a double of something stronger.” 
      p.fade
    | Cordie tried to avoid eye contact as she reached around Cy’s torso to grab a cardboard sleeve. She had a feeling it was not an accident he decided to rest his bony ass on the right side of her coffee station and not the left. “If I were you,” doing her best to keep her voice level, “I would stay at least ten feet away from me today. I’m not in the mood.”

  p.fade
    | Cordie physically flinched at the laugh that escaped Cy’s mouth, “You always say that, but forgive me for not believing it. I do have eyes, you know.” 
    
      p.fade
    | Cordie’s brow furrowed in confused frustration, “I can see that. Is there a reason you are stating the obvious? Should I do that same? I also have eyes. And I have an assignment to get to. And I’m going to be late. So, if you’ll excuse me.”

  p.fade
    |  Cordie swiped her steaming cup of coffee from the table and put the lid on all in one motion as she attempted to make her way to the cu-bus stop but halted at Cy’s words. “My obvious statement was an attempt to not-so-obviously tell you that I can see your very obvious glances over in my direction. Every time you enter a room. Every time I enter a room. And about every five minutes after.”
    
     p.fade
    | Cordie turned at his words, finding his brown eyes with her purple. She stared at him for a second, breaking eye contact to take note of him. He had let his dark stubble grow a little longer than normal, making him look less put together than normal. His hair was cut close to skin on the sides and slightly longer on top, a fairly recent and dramatic change from his shoulder length hair he’d had since Venus decided she liked man-buns again. It made him look older, she decided. She’d be lying if she said that she didn’t like it. She’d also be lying if she said she didn’t like a lot of thinks about him or that she didn’t do exactly what he just accused her of. But what did it matter? He was an asshole with a jealous and over-protective girlfriend, who got off on making her uncomfortable every chance her got. It was time to move on. 

  p.fade
    | She found his eyes again, doing her best to ignore the look she could see in his eyes. She knew what he wanted from her, but she was tired of giving it to him. 
    
     p.fade
    | “So what?” was all she gave him in response before continuing with the rest of her day, starting with a ride on the cu-bus. This is going to be a long day, they both thought as Cordie put more and more distance in between them.
